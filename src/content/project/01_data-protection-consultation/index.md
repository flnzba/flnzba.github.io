# Data Protection Consultation for an Opinion Polling Company

## **1. Title Page**

**Title:** Ensuring GDPR Compliance through Comprehensive Data Protection Measures  
**Company:** Redem GmbH  
**Prepared by:** Ing. Florian Zeba LL.B.  
**Project Start Date:** 01.11.2019

## **2. Executive Summary**

This case study details the consultation and implementation of data protection measures at Redem GmbH to ensure compliance with the newly introduced GDPR regulations. Redem GmbH, specializing in user surveys, required a comprehensive overhaul of its data collection, storage, and processing systems to meet legal standards. The project involved reengineering the database system, introducing user consent protocols, and implementing automated security responses. The result was a fully compliant system with enhanced security and streamlined reporting capabilities.

## **3. Introduction**

**Background:** Redem GmbH is a company focused on user surveys, collecting significant amounts of personal data. The introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) required the company to update its data handling processes.  
**Industry Context:** Data privacy regulations have become increasingly stringent, with non-compliance resulting in severe financial and reputational consequences.  
**Objectives:**

- To make Redem’s data processes compliant with GDPR standards.
- To implement automated security measures for data protection.
- To enable efficient and secure reporting of user data.

## **4. Problem Statement**

Redem GmbH’s existing MySQL database system lacked the necessary security protocols to comply with GDPR regulations. There were no mechanisms for user consent management, automated breach responses, or streamlined data reporting. Additionally, the system could not efficiently handle user requests for data access or deletion.

## **5. Analysis of the Situation**

### **SWOT Analysis:**

- **Strengths:**

  - Established data collection systems
  - Experienced technical team
  - Clear understanding of GDPR requirements

- **Weaknesses:**

  - Outdated database security protocols
  - No user consent management system
  - Lack of automated breach response mechanisms

- **Opportunities:**

  - Improve data security and operational efficiency
  - Build customer trust through transparent data practices
  - Gain a competitive advantage by becoming GDPR-compliant early

- **Threats:**
  - Potential fines for non-compliance with GDPR
  - Data breaches leading to reputational damage
  - Increasing regulatory scrutiny in the data processing industry

### **Industry Analysis (PESTEL):**

- **Political:** Strong enforcement of GDPR regulations across the EU
- **Economic:** High potential fines for non-compliance (up to 4% of annual turnover)
- **Social:** Growing public awareness and concern about data privacy
- **Technological:** Rapid advancements in cybersecurity and encryption technologies
- **Environmental:** Increasing use of digital records reduces paper usage
- **Legal:** Strict requirements under GDPR, including the right to access, erasure, and data portability

## **6. Proposed Solutions and Alternatives**

### **Solution 1 (Selected): Full GDPR Compliance Overhaul with Automated Systems**

- **Pros:** Comprehensive compliance, automated security responses, and efficient user data management
- **Cons:** High implementation cost and extended timeline

### **Solution 2: Minimal GDPR Compliance (Only Legal Requirements)**

- **Pros:** Lower cost and shorter implementation time
- **Cons:** Higher risk of non-compliance and potential security issues

### **Solution 3: Outsourcing Compliance Management to a Third-Party Provider**

- **Pros:** Quick implementation and reduced internal workload
- **Cons:** Ongoing dependency on external providers and less control over data processes

**Justification for Selected Solution:** Solution 1 was chosen due to its long-term benefits, including full compliance, enhanced security, and improved operational efficiency.

## **7. Implementation Plan**

- **Phase 1 (System Audit and Risk Assessment):**

  - Conduct a thorough audit of existing data processes and identify vulnerabilities.
  - Map out all data entry points and storage locations.

- **Phase 2 (Database Redesign and Consent Management):**

  - Redesign the MySQL database with a staging mechanism for data verification.
  - Implement a mandatory user consent feature linked to user records.

- **Phase 3 (Security Measures and Automation):**

  - Introduce automated responses to data breaches, such as database isolation and user notification.
  - Set up secure APIs for manual and automated data reporting.

- **Phase 4 (Training and Deployment):**

  - Provide training for employees on new GDPR-compliant processes.
  - Launch the new system and monitor performance.

- **Phase 5 (Monitoring and Compliance Testing):**
  - Conduct regular compliance audits and penetration testing.
  - Gather user feedback and refine processes accordingly.

## **8. Results and Outcomes**

- **GDPR Compliance:** All data processing activities were aligned with GDPR requirements.
- **Automated Security:** The system could now automatically isolate databases and notify users in case of a breach.
- **Efficient Reporting:** Secure APIs enabled quick responses to user data requests under Article 15 of the GDPR.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Automated processes reduced the workload on the IT and legal teams.

## **9. Lessons Learned**

- **Proactive Planning is Crucial:** Early involvement of legal and technical teams streamlined the compliance process.
- **Automation Reduces Human Error:** Automated processes improved efficiency and reliability.
- **User Education Enhances Security:** Employee training minimized compliance risks.

## **10. Conclusion**

The project successfully transformed Redem GmbH’s data processes, ensuring full GDPR compliance and enhancing data security. The implementation of automated responses and secure reporting mechanisms positioned the company as a leader in data protection within its industry.
