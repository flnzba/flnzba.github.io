# Starting the new Site

I am happy to announce (never wrote this on linkedIn - but on my own site - ironic) that my new site is up and running. I started with my own creation of the site. I then switched to a template from Chris Williams (Astro-Cactus) (I am not a good designer). As I changed the things in the backend for my needs, I realized how much was put in into this template (My thanks to Chris).

I am still working on the site and will add more content in the future. Some open TODOS are:
- Add every project individually to the site
- Do some individual styling
- etc

I am planning on providing some insights into my work through blog posts.

Thank you for reading.

Kind Regards
Florian
