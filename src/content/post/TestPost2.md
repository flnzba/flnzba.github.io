This is a test post to demonstrate how to add a cover/hero image to your post. You can add a cover image to your post by adding the `coverImage` field to the front matter of your post. The `coverImage` field should contain the `src` and `alt` attributes. The `src` attribute should contain the path to the image file, and the `alt` attribute should contain the alternative text for the image.
