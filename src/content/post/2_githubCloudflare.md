# How to Connect a Github Page to Your Own Domain and Set Up an Email Address

Are you looking to create a website for free? Github Pages is a great way to create and host a website for free. However, if you want to have your own domain and a custom email address, you can connect your Github Pages site to your domain and set up an email address associated with your domain.

## Connecting Your Github Pages Site to Your Domain

Before you can connect your Github Pages site to your domain, you need to have a Github account and a Github Pages site. Once you have created your Github Pages site, you can follow these steps to connect it to your domain:

1. Create a repo on Github.
2. Go to Settings and scroll down to the Github Pages section.
3. Under the Custom domain section, enter your domain name and click Save.
4. Go to your domain registrar and set the CNAME record to your Github Pages site. This will point your domain to your Github Pages site.
5. Wait for the DNS changes to propagate, which can take up to 24-48 hours.
6. Once the DNS changes have propagated, you should be able to see your Github Pages site at your custom domain.

## Setting Up an Email Address Associated with Your Domain

Once you have your custom domain set up, you can set up an email address associated with your domain. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Buy a domain name from a domain registrar such as Namecheap or GoDaddy.

1. Sign up for Cloudflare Mail and follow the instructions to verify your domain ownership.
2. In your Gmail account, go to Settings and click on the Accounts and Import tab.
