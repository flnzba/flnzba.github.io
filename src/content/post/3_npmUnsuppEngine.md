When error occurs: “unsupported engine” while trying to update npm to 10.1. a solution is to use nvm.

It does not solve the underlying problem in itself but it is a workaround.

With nvm it is possible to manage node versions on the system and easily install and use more then one node version in parallel.

1. [Installing nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/tree/master#installing-and-updating)

2. [Using nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/tree/master#usage)

3. [Installing oh-my-zsh-nvm plugin (when zsh is in use)](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/nvm)

Done.
